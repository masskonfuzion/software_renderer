# Mass KonFuzion's Software Renderer

This repo contains various projects related to my learning 3D rendering.  That is to say: I don't NOT know 3D rendering, but there's a lot about 3D graphics that I know only superficially, or that I otherwise "understand" so far as a 3D engine or tool does work for me.
